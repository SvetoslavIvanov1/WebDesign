<h1>Security Considerations</h1>
<p>First Of all the admin page should not be part of users s point of view (user must to see the it)
The admin page must have a log in screen because everyone can add a holiday that way not just the admin.
The website should have HTTPS(Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) it is a internet protocol
that defends the integrity and confidentiality of data between the user and the site.
Users receive a secure and private online experience when using a webstie. And website developers
    receive TLS(which provides three important layers of protection.</p>
<p>1.Encryption- The exchanged data to keep it secure from eavesdroppers. When a users is browsing a website nobody can li
    nobody can listen in to their conversation , track activities and steal information.</p>
    <p>2.Data integrity- Data cannot be modified during the transfer.</p>
<p>3.Authentication - Provides that your users communicate with the intended website. It protects
againts MITM (man in the middle attacks)
</p>
<p>Google Webmasters Secure your site with HTTPS 2018 </p>
